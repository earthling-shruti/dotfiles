# The editing-mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is
# used. By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where the
# keystrokes are most similar to Emacs. This variable can be set to either
# 'emacs' or 'vi'.
set editing-mode vi

# If you have this in your /etc/inputrc or ~/.inputrc, you will no longer
# have to hit the <Tab> key twice to produce a list of all possible
# completions. A single <Tab> will suffice. This setting is highly recommended.

# Sets Readline's idea of the current keymap for key binding commands.
# Acceptable `keymap' names are `emacs', `emacs-standard', `emacs-meta',
# `emacs-ctlx', `vi', `vi-command', and `vi-insert'. `vi' is equivalent to
# `vi-command'; `emacs' is equivalent to `emacs-standard'.  The default
# value is `emacs'.  The value of the `editing-mode' variable also affects
# the default keymap.
set keymap vi
